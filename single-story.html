                                <p>It’s cold now in Zimbabwe and I’m wearing a hat with big “USA” letters written on it. I won it in a 
                                    week long Sudoku challenge, a game I had never played before. It’s something to be proud of, I 
                                    know, but it almost feels like a painful consolation for larger, missed opportunities.

                                <p>On my lap is my nine month old baby, Dwayne. I’m reading to him. A book called, ​Quantum

                                        <p>Not long ago, everything was different. I was just 
                                            halfway through secondary school, when I stumbled 
                                            into a new, after-school computer coding program 
                                            that had popped up in my community, Dzivarasekwa 
                                            - a small, low-income neighborhood in Zimbabwe. I 
                                            didn’t know anything about programming and had 
                                            hardly even held a computer in my own hands, but 
                                            coding came naturally to me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Although I was a late addition to the class, I was 
                                            helping to tutor the older boys just a few days after 
                                            joining. My instructors must have taken notice 
                                            because before long I was encouraged to apply for a 
                                            position in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion 
                                            program in New York City.

                                <p>When you’re sixteen and come from a poor town in a poor country in a poor part of the world, the idea of studying in 
                                    America is hardly even a dream. You don’t know anyone that has been to America, let alone New York City. But when 
                                    you’re sixteen, you do what your teachers say and go along with it, even if you’ll forget about the application the 
                                    moment it’s submitted.
                                </p>
                                <p>Sometimes it’s just easier to make people happy.</p>
                                <p> But sometimes crazy things happen too. Sometimes, dreams do become reality, and you get accepted. No, not just 
                                    accepted, you get ​invited​ to America, to New York City, to spend the summer coding with girls your age from all over 
                                    the country. That moment is indescribable, so it’s hardly worth trying.
                                </p>
                                <p>The days after finding out I was accepted were euphoric. Until they weren’t.</p>
                                <p>When you’re sixteen and find out that you’re pregnant, you get scared. Just a few days earlier you were living a dream 
                                    but then, reality, as it does, comes crashing down. Telling your parents is one of the hardest parts. After I did, I ended 
                                    up running away for three months to live with my boyfriend’s family.
                                </p>
                                <p>I desperately wanted to keep the baby, and there was no way I wouldn’t. Just like me, my baby boy represented the 
                                    future. For Zimbabwe and for the world. So began the sacrifices.

                                        <p>My decision meant giving up my dream of going to America, and 
                                            leaving school and the coding class I loved behind. Zimbabwe is 
                                            not an easy place to live. The country has been cut off from 
                                            much of the world for years and record hyperinflation has left 
                                            the economy in shambles. Today there is over 90% 
                                            unemployment. Even public school isn’t free. Although I had to 
                                            put school aside, I was determined to create a better life for my 
                                            soon to be born son. <br>
                                            The next few months were intense and scary. I was just a child 
                                            preparing for childbirth. But there was an undeniable resolve 
                                            inside of me, perhaps it was Dwayne, that pushed me forward, 
                                            despite the questions of how our little family would survive.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Not long after Dwayne was born, I was hit by a stroke of good 
                                            luck. My instructors had been looking for me. It had been 
                                            months since we last spoke. Embarrassment, fear, heartbreak, 
                                            stress, priorities - there are countless reasons why. But hope 
                                            was not all lost. They asked me, when I was ready, to join the 
                                            program again. This time as an instructor.
                                        </p>

                                <p>Again, I felt overcome with euphoria. This was an opportunity I wouldn’t miss for the world. This was an opportunity, 
                                    not just for me, but for Dwayne.
                                </p>
                                <p>Today, I have my own computer and phone and I earn a monthly stipend to help support my family. I’m managing a 
                                    team of four Instructors and am currently building a website for the school we teach at: the elementary school I went

                                        <p>Life still isn’t easy, but it’s full of hope and potential. I wake 
                                            up early every morning to build a fire and prepare 
                                            breakfast for Dwayne, my husband having left before 5am 
                                            to head to work. I drop my son off with my mother or 
                                            mother-in-law then continue the walk to work. In the 
                                            mornings I study web development and work with my team 
                                            of instructors on how to improve the job we’re doing in the 
                                            classroom. Then, in the afternoon, we head out to teach 
                                            our classes.

                                        <p>My dream is to become a talented software engineer and 
                                            build my own company here in Zimbabwe. It is hard to deny 
                                            that my country has its fair share of problems, but within 
                                            each problem there are so many potential solutions. 
                                            Everywhere we go, we are surrounded by opportunities. My 
                                            goal is to leverage the skills I’m learning now to provide 
                                            for my family and build towards a brighter future. I wish to 
                                            be an inspiration to young mothers everywhere. I hope 
                                            they’ll find hope in my story - a story which has only just 
                                            begun.

                                <p>It’s cold now in Zimbabwe and I’m wearing a hat with big “USA” letters written on it. I won it in a 
                                    week long Sudoku challenge, a game I had never played before. It’s something to be proud of, I 
                                    know, but it almost feels like a painful consolation for larger, missed opportunities.

                                        <p>Not long ago, everything was different. I was just 
                                            halfway through secondary school, when I stumbled 
                                            into a new, after-school computer coding program 
                                            that had popped up in my community, Dzivarasekwa 
                                            - a small, low-income neighborhood in Zimbabwe. I 
                                            didn’t know anything about programming and had 
                                            hardly even held a computer in my own hands, but 
                                            coding came naturally to me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Although I was a late addition to the class, I was 
                                            helping to tutor the older boys just a few days after 
                                            joining. My instructors must have taken notice 
                                            because before long I was encouraged to apply for a 
                                            position in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion 
                                            program in New York City.

                                <p>When you’re sixteen and come from a poor town in a poor country in a poor part of the world, the idea of studying in 
                                    America is hardly even a dream. You don’t know anyone that has been to America, let alone New York City. But when 
                                    you’re sixteen, you do what your teachers say and go along with it, even if you’ll forget about the application the 
                                    moment it’s submitted.
                                </p>
                                <p>Sometimes it’s just easier to make people happy.</p>
                                <p> But sometimes crazy things happen too. Sometimes, dreams do become reality, and you get accepted. No, not just 
                                    accepted, you get ​invited​ to America, to New York City, to spend the summer coding with girls your age from all over 
                                    the country. That moment is indescribable, so it’s hardly worth trying.
                                </p>
                                <p>The days after finding out I was accepted were euphoric. Until they weren’t.</p>
                                <p>When you’re sixteen and find out that you’re pregnant, you get scared. Just a few days earlier you were living a dream 
                                    but then, reality, as it does, comes crashing down. Telling your parents is one of the hardest parts. After I did, I ended 
                                    up running away for three months to live with my boyfriend’s family.
                                </p>
                                <p>I desperately wanted to keep the baby, and there was no way I wouldn’t. Just like me, my baby boy represented the 
                                    future. For Zimbabwe and for the world. So began the sacrifices.

                                        <p>My decision meant giving up my dream of going to America, and 
                                            leaving school and the coding class I loved behind. Zimbabwe is 
                                            not an easy place to live. The country has been cut off from 
                                            much of the world for years and record hyperinflation has left 
                                            the economy in shambles. Today there is over 90% 
                                            unemployment. Even public school isn’t free. Although I had to 
                                            put school aside, I was determined to create a better life for my 
                                            soon to be born son. <br>
                                            The next few months were intense and scary. I was just a child 
                                            preparing for childbirth. But there was an undeniable resolve 
                                            inside of me, perhaps it was Dwayne, that pushed me forward, 
                                            despite the questions of how our little family would survive.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Not long after Dwayne was born, I was hit by a stroke of good 
                                            luck. My instructors had been looking for me. It had been 
                                            months since we last spoke. Embarrassment, fear, heartbreak, 
                                            stress, priorities - there are countless reasons why. But hope 
                                            was not all lost. They asked me, when I was ready, to join the 
                                            program again. This time as an instructor.

                                <p>Again, I felt overcome with euphoria. This was an opportunity I wouldn’t miss for the world. This was an opportunity, 
                                    not just for me, but for Dwayne.

                                <p>Today, I have my own computer and phone and I earn a monthly stipend to help support my family. I’m managing a 
                                    team of four Instructors and am currently building a website for the school we teach at: the elementary school I went 
                                    to and the place where I first learned how to code.

                                        <p>Life still isn’t easy, but it’s full of hope and potential. I wake 
                                            up early every morning to build a fire and prepare 
                                            breakfast for Dwayne, my husband having left before 5am 
                                            to head to work. I drop my son off with my mother or 
                                            mother-in-law then continue the walk to work. In the 
                                            mornings I study web development and work with my team 
                                            of instructors on how to improve the job we’re doing in the 
                                            classroom. Then, in the afternoon, we head out to teach

                                        <p>My dream is to become a talented software engineer and 
                                            build my own company here in Zimbabwe. It is hard to deny 
                                            that my country has its fair share of problems, but within 
                                            each problem there are so many potential solutions. 
                                            Everywhere we go, we are surrounded by opportunities. My 
                                            goal is to leverage the skills I’m learning now to provide 
                                            for my family and build towards a brighter future. I wish to 
                                            be an inspiration to young mothers everywhere. I hope 
                                            they’ll find hope in my story - a story which has only just 
                                            begun.
