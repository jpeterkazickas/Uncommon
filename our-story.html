                            <h2>The Uncommon Story</h2>
                            <p> In 2018, we began this journey with the following founding mission: <span>to 
                                leverage the power of technology to create educational & economic 
                                opportunities for disenfranchised communities.</span>  We did this by hiring 
                                young adults in low-income neighborhoods and teaching them how to 
                                teach our  youth coding curriculum. Right away we were creating jobs 
                                and giving young students their ever first coding experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p> We learned a few lessons early on, however, that changed everything. 
                                Not only could we not afford to scale a model of training & hiring 
                                “teachers”, we didn’t want those young adults to be teachers at all. We 
                                wanted them to be <span>students</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p> So we began to think. How could we get our young adults to become 
                                students without giving up what we’d built? And how could we monetize 
                                the skills we were teaching for free, to take some of  the burden off of 
                                our traditional fundraising efforts - making scale more realistic?
                            </p>
                            <p> We decided to prioritize the young adults, and we built a Tech Bootcamp 
                                just for them. But we couldn’t stand the thought of losing a single one 
                                of our super genius young coding All Stars, so we kept them too. Today 
                                when a young adult joins our program, not only are they learning the 
                                most in-demand tech skills for free, they’re volunteering daily, giving 
                                coding lessons at the local schools in their communities.

                    to say that 100% of a public donation goes directly to growing our program. Here’s how we

                            <h2>our vision for the future</h2>
                            <p> We see a world where anyone, anywhere, has equal opportunity to improve their 
                                lives through technology. The internet is perhaps the most powerful 
                                and democratizing force of our time, but universal internet access alone is not enough. 
                            </p>
                            <p> We believe in taking a grassroots approach and investing in communities and 
                                people for the long-term, combining both in-person and online resources to create 
                                the most wholesome learning experience. Building physical environments where 
                                creativity, collaboration and entrepreneurship can thrive is foundational for this 
                                vision. 
                            </p>
                            <p> We also see a beautiful optimism in the rising generations. A spirit of philanthropy 
                                and giving that has embedded itself in the way we live, work and do business. 
                                Companies like TOMS and Warby Parker have been pioneers of the 1 for 1 business 
                                model. We’re just taking it one step further. 
                            </p>
                            <p> In being a non-profit, we are mandated by law to put impact ahead of profit. But 
                                that doesn’t mean that we can’t look at capitalism and profit maximization for 
                                inspiration. We have figured out how to monetize the skills we’re teaching - there 
                                just aren’t any shareholders who benefit at the end; just more students, from 
                                more underprivileged walks off life who will get to learn the skills they need to lift 
                                themselves out of poverty. 
                            </p>
                            <p>We believe that this business model will win out, and will enable us to achieve 
                                global scale and impact. We hope you’ll join us.
